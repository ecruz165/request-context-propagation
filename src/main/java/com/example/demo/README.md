# Request Context Propagation Framework
==========================

A declarative, configuration-driven framework for extracting, storing, and propagating request context across distributed services. This framework runs **BEFORE** Spring Security to capture context information even for failed authentication attempts.

## üéØ Overview

The Request Context Propagation Framework provides a zero-code solution for managing request context (user IDs, tenant IDs, correlation IDs, etc.) across your microservices architecture. Define your context requirements in YAML, and the framework automatically:

- **Extracts** context from incoming requests (JWT, headers, cookies, etc.)
- **Enriches** observability spans with context for DataDog/tracing
- **Propagates** context to downstream services via WebClient/RestTemplate
- **Injects** context into logs via MDC
- **Validates** required context values

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Architecture: Enhanced Filter + Service + Enricher Pattern

1. **RequestContextFilter (Runs BEFORE Spring Security)**
   - Delegates to RequestContextService for context initialization
   - Extracts non-authenticated sources (headers, cookies, query params, path variables, etc.)
   - Generates requestId and captures request metadata
   - Sets up basic MDC for early logging with structured JSON support
   - Provides request timing and duration tracking

2. **RequestContextInterceptor (Runs AFTER Spring Security, BEFORE Controller)**
   - Uses RequestContextService for authenticated data enrichment
   - Extracts JWT claims and principal information
   - Captures handler information (controller, method, annotations)
   - Updates MDC with complete context for comprehensive logging
   - Enriches response headers and validates required fields

3. **RequestContextService (Core Orchestration Layer)**
   - Coordinates all context operations with RequestContextExtractor and RequestContextEnricher
   - Manages context lifecycle, validation, and MDC updates
   - Provides metrics and tracing field extraction with cardinality control
   - Handles downstream response enrichment and sensitive data masking

4. **RequestContextEnricher (NEW - Transformation and Propagation)**
   - Centralizes value transformation (BASE64, URL encoding, JSON, expressions)
   - Handles condition evaluation and expression processing
   - Provides structured PropagationData for WebClient filters
   - Supports multiple enrichment types (HEADER, QUERY, COOKIE, ATTRIBUTE)

5. **RequestContextExtractor (Low-Level Extraction)**
   - Handles multi-source extraction from 10+ source types
   - Supports JWT parsing, path pattern matching, and session extraction
   - Provides error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Key Benefits

- **Complete Context in Controller**: All data (headers, JWT claims, handler info) is available when your controller executes
- **Structured JSON Logging**: Enhanced Logback configuration with custom RequestContextJsonProvider for comprehensive log correlation
- **Centralized Enrichment**: RequestContextEnricher provides reusable transformation and condition logic across the framework
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with RequestContextService orchestrating all operations
- **Enhanced WebClient Integration**: Filters now leverage service layer for consistent context management and transformation
- **Handler Information**: The interceptor captures detailed handler metadata:
  - Controller class name and method name
  - Custom annotations (@ApiOperation, @RequestMapping)
  - Request mapping patterns and HTTP methods
- **Multi-Source Extraction**: Support for 10+ source types including JWT claims, path variables, session, attributes, form data, and request body
- **Production-Ready Logging**: Multiple profile support (dev, json, prod) with async logging and file rotation

- **Rich Logging**: Your logs will include:
  ```
  INFO  [requestId=abc-123, handler=UserController.getUser, principal=john.doe, applicationId=app-1]
  Getting user details...
  ```

- **Metrics with Context**: You can record metrics tagged with handler names, making it easy to track performance per endpoint
- **Two-Phase Extraction**:
  - Early extraction for non-auth data (useful for rate limiting, early logging)
  - Late extraction for auth data and handler info (complete context for business logic)

### Execution Flow
1. **Request arrives** ‚Üí HTTP request enters the application
2. **RequestContextFilter** ‚Üí Extract headers, cookies, generate requestId (BEFORE Spring Security)
3. **Spring Security** ‚Üí Authentication and authorization processing
4. **RequestContextInterceptor.preHandle()** ‚Üí Extract JWT claims + handler info (AFTER Spring Security)
5. **Controller executes** ‚Üí Business logic runs with complete context available
6. **RequestContextInterceptor.postHandle()** ‚Üí Capture response headers and enrich response
7. **RequestContextInterceptor.afterCompletion()** ‚Üí Record metrics, log completion, cleanup
8. **RequestContextFilter finally block** ‚Üí Final cleanup and context removal
